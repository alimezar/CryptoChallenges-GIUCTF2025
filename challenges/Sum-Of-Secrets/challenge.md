# Challenge: Sum of Secrets

## Description

They say RSA is secure because factoring large numbers is hard.

But what if we gave you just a little too much?

Intercepted ciphertext. Leaky parameters. A prime hint hidden in plain sight.

Your mission: tear apart RSA, reverse the twist, and decrypt the real message.
