## Description

These numbers may look readable — but something’s been added.  
A short numeric key, on repeat, was used to shift each character.

Can you find the hidden message?

## Hint
> From the numbers one through nine,  
> Select just three to forge your line,  
> Then loop them in order, over and through,  
> To shift each letter back to view.
